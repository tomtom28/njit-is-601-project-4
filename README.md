# IS 601 - Project 4

## Project Description
This project's goal to build a Flask Application by following [this tutorial](https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application).

This repository contains many independent projects. There is one folder for each part of the tutorial and a `my-final-project` folder for modifying 
[Project 3](https://github.com/tomtom28/njit-is-601-project-3) to include authentication and `ENV` variables.

Each project runs independently in its own Docker container and on its own port number, as provided in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
